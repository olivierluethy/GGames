<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
At the company, I was working on a big project with another colleague. It was a web-based software. To realize this project we used the languages PHP and JavaScript. For the database we used MySQL. 
During the development of the software, I was fascinated by what you can develop with PHP and MySQL. 

After that, I started many small projects, but most of them turned out to be nothing. So I decided to start my first own big project. Since I always wanted to create a store, I decided to use PHP and MySQL to create a
to create a game store similar to Steam. I structured the code almost the same as the one we used for the company's project.

When I first started programming, I often got annoyed when things didn't work the way I wanted them to. I often had to delete and rebuild the project because there were too many bugs in the code. After a few months, things started to get better. I was able to finish a large part, but not the heart of the project. By that, I mean that a logged-in user could buy games from the site. You could only add, edit, or delete games. But not buy them. I held on to that goal for a long time.

Later I went to an inter-company course for about a week. There I learned how to work with PHP and the MVC pattern. I learned it very quickly and started with some small projects. Most of them turned out to be nothing though. One of them was the TackPad application.

After half a year, the company tested me to see how good I really was. I had to program a large web application. When I was able to complete every single task of the assignment, I realized how good I really was.

After that, I decided to continue working on my game store, which was a dream of mine to finally finish. I started all over again. 

It took me a long time to program everything perfectly. About 1 to 2 weeks. When I finished a big part of the project, I spent hours fixing the bugs, except for buying games. After about 4 hours I was finally able to finish it, and I was so extremely happy to finish something I had been working on for so long.
