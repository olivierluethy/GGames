<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In the company I worked together with another colleague on a large project. It was a web based software. To realize this project we used the languages PHP and JavaScript. For the database we used MySQL. 
During the development of the software I was fascinated by what you can develop with PHP and MySQL. 

After that I started with many small projects, but most of them turned out to be nothing. So I decided to start my first own big project. Since I always wanted to create a store, I decided to create with PHP and MySQL
to develop a game store similar to Steam. I structured the code almost the same as the one we used for the project from the company.

When I first started programming, I often got annoyed that things didn't work the way I wanted them to. Often I had to delete and restart the project because there were too many bugs in the code. After a few months, things started to get better. I was able to finish a large part, but not the heart of the project. By that I mean that a logged in user could buy games from the website. One could only add, edit or delete games. But not buy them. I held on to that goal for quite a long time.

Later, I went to an inter-company course for about a week. There I learned how to work with PHP and the MVC pattern. I learned it very quickly and started with some small projects. However, most of them turned into nothing. One of them was the TackPad application.

After half a year the company tested me to see how good I actually was. I had to program a big web application. When I was able to complete every single task of the assignment, I realized how good I actually was.

After that I decided to continue working on my game store, which was a dream for me to finally finish. In the process, I started all over again. 

It took me quite a long time to program everything perfectly. About 1 to 2 weeks. When I finished a big part of the project, I spent hours fixing the bugs, except for buying games. After about 4 hours I was finally able to finish it and I was so extremely happy to finish something I had worked on for so long.
